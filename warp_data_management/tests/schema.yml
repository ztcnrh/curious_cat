    description: >
      This test verifies that the sum of all user categories (new, retained, churned, resurrected, and inactive) 
      equals the total number of records in the table. This ensures that:
      - Every record is properly categorized
      - No record is double-counted
      - No record is missing a category
      
      The test will fail if there's any discrepancy between the sum of all categories and the total record count.
